# eui-ruby

EUI applications, written in Ruby.

[EUI](https://github.com/solisoft/eui) delivers an application interface over
HTTPS without HTML, CSS or JavaScript. The server sends a tree that is
**already resolved**, in a compact binary encoding; a native client applies
it, lays it out and draws it on the GPU. There is no tolerant parse at the
other end, no cascade to resolve, no script to run.

This gem is the server half: the wire format, the view encoder and its diff,
the session, the content-addressed asset store, the signed manifest, and a
component model in which a view is a hash and a handler changes state.

```ruby
require "eui"

class Counter < EUI::Component
  def mount(params)
    super          # the window, as it is right now
    @count = 0
  end

  on("increment") { @count += 1 }

  def render
    column(gap: 5, align: "center", justify: "center",
           width: "100%", height: "100%", bg: "surface.base") do
      [text(@count.to_s, size: "4xl", weight: "bold"),
       button("Increment", "increment")]
    end
  end
end

app = EUI::App.new(name: "Counter", app_id: "counter.example")
app.mount("counter", Counter)
app.run(port: 5099)
```

```
EUI_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOOPBACK=1 eui ws://127.0.0.1:5099/_eui/session/counter
```

Pressing the button sends **one** `SetText`. Not a page, not a diffed DOM,
not a frame of JSON: the style records went once, at mount, and every later
render names them by id.

## What a view is

A hash, and a pure function of the state. `EUI::DSL` — included in every
component — builds them, but there is nothing behind the helpers: print one
and you have the whole document.

```ruby
{"k" => "box", "s" => {"display" => "column", "gap" => 4},
 "c" => [{"k" => "text", "t" => "Hi", "s" => {"size" => "lg"}}]}
```

- **`k`** one of the seventeen primitive kinds. Everything a person would
  call a widget — button, dialog, table, date picker — is composed from
  these on the server, which is why the catalogue grows without shipping a
  new client.
- **`s`** a flat style hash in the spec's own vocabulary. An unknown key is
  an error, not a key that does nothing.
- **`c`** children, **`t`** text, **`p`** props, **`on`** handlers,
  **`key`** identity for reconciliation.

**[eui.solisoft.net/components](https://eui.solisoft.net/components) is the
reference for all of it** — every node key, all seventeen kinds, every style
key and all thirty-three colour roles, the event names, and the catalogue of
composed widgets, each one shown with the hash it returns. It is written
against Soli, and the vocabulary is the protocol's, so a style hash or a node
on that page is the same style hash and the same node here. The rest of the
site is worth the visit too: [the running demo](https://eui.solisoft.net/demo),
[the controls](https://eui.solisoft.net/controls) every widget is built from,
and [what is not there yet](https://eui.solisoft.net/gaps).

Colour is a **role** — `surface.raised`, `text.muted`, `danger.base` — never
a literal. The client resolves it against the viewer's theme, so the page is
right in dark mode *without this server ever learning which mode they are
in*. Sizes are scale indices, by index or by name: `size: "lg"`, `gap: 4`,
`radius: "md"`.

What this gem ships is the primitives plus a few composed widgets — `button`,
`card`, `field`, `divider`, `spacer`. Anything else in the catalogue is a
function that returns a hash, so it ports to Ruby by writing the same hash.

```ruby
column(gap: 4, pad: 6, bg: "surface.base") do
  [ text("Total", size: "sm", fg: "text.muted"),
    text(format("%.2f", @total), size: "2xl", font: "mono"),
    row(gap: 3) { [button("Save", "save"), button("Delete", "delete", tone: "danger")] },
    divider,
    keyed("row-#{id}", card { [text(name)] }) ]
end
```

## What a handler is

A block, or a method, named by the **view** rather than by the event kind —
`{"on" => {"wake" => "tick"}}` arrives as `tick`. It changes state and
returns; it never touches the tree.

```ruby
on("pick") { |params| @selected = params["props"]["id"] }
```

`params` carries `node`, `kind`, `payload` and `props` — the node's props as
the server last rendered them. That last one is what lets one handler serve
ten thousand rows: put the identifying value on the node, not in the
handler's name.

A handler that raises leaves the state unchanged and the screen right; it is
a line in the log, not the end of somebody's session. A **view** that cannot
be encoded is the other way round: it fails identically on every later
render, so the session ends with `Error 400` and the reason.

## Running it

| | |
|---|---|
| `app.run(port: 5099)` | plain `ws://` on loopback, for development |
| `app.run(host: "0.0.0.0", port: 443, tls: {cert:, key:})` | TLS 1.3, which is the protocol's floor |

A release client refuses `ws://` outright; a debug one takes
`EUI_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOOPBACK=1`. `EUI_TRACE=1` on the server prints every
frame and every event a session sees, which is the first thing to reach for
when a click does nothing.

Three endpoints, and nothing else: `/.well-known/eui` (the signed manifest),
`/_eui/asset/<blake3-hex>` (content-addressed, immutable, served to anyone),
and the session itself.

```ruby
app = EUI::App.new(name: "Books", app_id: "books.example",
                   key_path: "config/eui_publisher.pem",
                   capabilities: %w[net.open])
app.font("Space Grotesk", ["public/fonts/space-grotesk-400.ttf",
                           "public/fonts/space-grotesk-700.ttf"])
```

The publisher key is generated on first use and kept: a client pins it
against `app_id` on first run and refuses a different one later. It belongs
to the application, not to a deployment, and it never belongs in a
repository.

## What is here, and what is not

Implemented: the whole wire format of `spec/02` (checked against the byte
vectors that document pins), the session frames of `spec/01`, the view
encoder with its append-only tables, a keyed diff that reorders by
`MoveChild`, assets, fonts, notifications, `scroll_to` and `focus_to`, the
manifest, and BLAKE3 in Ruby because an asset is named by the hash of its
content.

Not yet:

- **Local handlers** (`spec/07`). A handler is a server round trip; the
  bytecode a client runs for itself — the hover that answers without a
  packet — is the next milestone.
- **File transfers** (`spec/01` §6): `Upload` and `Blob` are decoded and
  dropped.
- **Session resume** (`spec/01` §4.1): a socket that breaks gets a fresh
  session and a fresh `Mount`, which is a conforming answer and a worse one.
- The windowed `list`'s `window` event, and `scene` uniforms.

## Tests

```
rake test
# or, with nothing installed but Ruby itself:
ruby -Ilib -Itest -e 'Dir["test/**/*_test.rb"].each { |f| require File.expand_path(f) }'
```

61 of them, and the ones worth reading are `test/proto_test.rb` — the spec's
own §8 example, 150 bytes, byte for byte — and `test/session_test.rb`, which
runs a real application on a real socket and counts the ops a click costs.

## Against the other six

The same application, written seven times — in Soli, Ruby, Python, PHP,
JavaScript, Go and Rust, node for node. [`bench/`](bench/) holds all seven and
the one driver that measures them, each phase timed until the server goes
quiet. At 500 rows, one number changed: **9 bytes** out of every one of them,
13.8 ms in Soli, 22.9 ms here, 8.3 ms in Node, 2.4 ms in Rust. The bytes being
identical is the protocol's claim; the rest ranks by runtime, and the memory
column ranks what else is in the process. [`bench/README.md`](bench/README.md)
has the tables, the method and the caveats.
